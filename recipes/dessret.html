        These Oatmeal Fried Bananas are coated in a crispy shell of rolled oats. Served with a generous drizzle of honey, these make for a delicious simple dessert.
       
        These fried bananas are coated in a generous layer of rolled oats and deep-fried, giving them a nutty granola coating. When drizzled with honey and served with dollop of ice cream, they make a simple dessert with a crispy golden crust and warm creamy middle. It’s a fun nod to the breakfast favorite, but more importantly it’s delicious.</p>
        
        <p>While you can make this with regular bananas, if you can find them, lady finger bananas work better. That’s because they’re about half the length of a regular banana, making them easy to coat with oats and fry. If you do use regular bananas, cut them in half to make them easier to work with.</p>
