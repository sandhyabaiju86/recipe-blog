    <h1>CHICKEN KARAAGE (JAPANESE FRIED CHICKEN)</h1>
    <img src="../images/karaage-chicken.jpg" alt="chicken karaage"  style="width: 600px; height: 600px;">
    <p>Karaage, is a deep-fried dish where a protein or vegetable is coated in potato starch and deep-fried until crisp.
        Chicken is the most common protein, but it’s also made with seafood, such as blowfish. These days, Karaage is
        almost always seasoned, but this wasn’t always the case.

        KARAAGE (から揚げ) VS. TATSUTAAGE (竜田揚げ)
        Historically, the term Karaage referred to any ingredient coated with flour or starch and then deep-fried
        without being seasoned.

        To the east of Osaka, there is a river called Tastutagawa, which is famous for the beautiful autumn foliage
        surrounding it. When chicken is marinated in soy sauce before being coated in starch and fried, it turns the
        color of autumn leaves, which is how Tastutaage is said to have gotten its name. By this definition, what most
        of us know as Karaage is technically Tastutaage.

        That being said, in modern parlance, the two names are used interchangeably, and while there may be some
        regional preferences, “Karaage” is the more commonly used of the two.</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <h4>For chicken</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sake</li>
        <li>25 grams &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; fresh ginger (grated</li>
        <li>900 grams &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; skin-on boneless chicken thighs (cut into bite-size pieces)</li>
        <li>170 grams &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; potato starchvegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>1/2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lemon (sliced into wedges for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the soy sauce, sake and ginger together in a bowl to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and mix well to ensure each piece of chicken is coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate, allowing the chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to fry the karaage, add 1 inch of vegetable oil in a heavy bottomed pot and heat until the oil reaches 340 degrees F (170 C). Prepare a paper towel-lined rack.</li>
        <li>While you wait for the oil to come up to temperature, dredge the marinated chicken in potato starch to coat each piece evenly and set the pieces of coated chicken on a tray.</li>
        <li>When the oil ready, fry the coated chicken in batches. Don’t overcrowd the pot, and I recommend batching pieces of chicken that are roughly the same size.</li>
        <li>When the karaage hits an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (71 C), transfer them to the prepared rack and let them rest for a few minutes before serving them.</li>
